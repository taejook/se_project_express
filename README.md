# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
# Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file sprint.txt in the root folder. The file sprint.txt should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

# Description
This back-end project creates a server for the WTWR application. The server used for the project is a MongoDB server attached to "Postman", which is a server testing application. Through the collaboration of these two technologies a server for adding clothing items and creating specific users can be implemented. In addition to direct error handling, the server provides API authentication capabilities so users can see only what belongs to them.
